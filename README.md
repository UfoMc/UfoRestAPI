Hello :D 

#Aboud
 - I uploaded my own RestAPI. If you notice any possible bugs please feel free to contact me via discord (ufo.dev).
 - You can also contact me on discord if you have any questions about the usage or anything else.

#Usage

 - The rest API uses the port 4281 for web interactions. If this port is already used for you just change it. 
 - Currently only MongoDB is supportet so if you use an other data base you have to change the code a bit
 - The MongoClient is binded on the standart Mongo Port. If you use an other port for your Database you got to change that up.
 - Use the RequestBuilder.jar to build a Request.
 - example: `http://127.0.0.1/webInteraction/database=<my database>&searchField=<user id or so>`
 - Following http methodes are supported: `POST, PUT, GET, DELETE`

#Copyright
 - The Ufo Rest API is free 2 use. If u give me a credit or not is your choise. Please dont use it for commercial purposes!
